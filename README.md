# CommandControl
CommandControl is a plugin for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20-1.21.x designed to hide commands, as well as block the usage of commands. Fully customizable and easy to use. It also blocks the usage of syntax commands (commands containing a colon (:)), as well as displays a generic "Unknown Command" error when trying to run a command that does not exist or the user does not have permission for, overwriting other plugin-specific "Unknown Command" error messages.

# Commands
/blockcommand - The main plugin command. Add, remove, or list blocked commands.
/blockc - Alias for /blockcommand.

# Configuration
Once you've placed this plugin into your server's plugins folder, you can customize it via config.yml.
